a) Problems with File System Data Management

1. Same data stored in multiple files can lead to mismatched values.
2. Data is scattered or isolated in different files and formats, making access difficult.
3. No constraints like primary keys are integrated to ensure valid data.
4. Multiple users accessing the same data can cause conflicts.
5.There is no centralized control for data access and permissions.

b) Usage of Composite Primary Key
A Composite Primary Key is a primary key that consists of two or more attributes used together to uniquely identify a record.
Example:
In a table Enrollment(Student_ID, Course_ID, Grade),
Neither Student_ID nor Course_ID alone is unique,
But the combination (Student_ID, Course_ID) uniquely identifies each enrollment record.
Hence, (Student_ID, Course_ID) is a composite primary key.

c) Operations Performed by Application Program When DBMS is Used

When an application interacts with a DBMS, it performs:
Data definition in which it Creates or modifies database schema (DDL).
Data is manipulated by inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving records (DML).
Data is controlled by managing access permissions and transactions (DCL).
Transaction management is ensured as atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID).

d) Which Independence is Difficult to Achieve in Three-Schema Architecture and Why

Physical Data Independence is easier to achieve whereas Logical Data Independence is difficult to achieve.

Reason:
Changes at the logical level (e.g., adding new fields or tables) may affect the external views and the application programs using those views.
Example:
If a new attribute Email is added to the Student table, all user views and applications that access student records might need modification to include or ignore that new field.

e) A Key is a Superkey but Not Vice Versa

A superkey is any set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record.
A key (candidate key) is a minimal superkey — meaning no attribute can be removed without losing uniqueness.

Example:
Consider relation Student(RollNo, Name, Phone)
{RollNo} uniquely identifies each student → Key (also a superkey).
{RollNo, Name} also uniquely identifies each student → Superkey, but not a key (since RollNo alone is sufficient).
Thus, every key is a superkey, but not every superkey is a key.
